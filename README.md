# atsl
American Truck Simulator Logger.

Is a HTML, JS, and CSS project. Currently it simple is a type my ATS details in, submit them which logs them to the record section below, and over time it will accumulate a
large list of job logs which can be exported as a PDF and then you can reset the record.

Don't worrie as lone as you don't clear you browing history you sould never lose you record unless you or someone else preforms an action that could reset them.
