# atsl
American Truck Simulator Logger.

Is a HTML, JS, and CSS project. Currently, in simple terms, it is a place to enter ATS details in, submit them, which logs them to the record section below, and over time, it will accumulate into a large list of job logs, which can be exported as a PDF and then you can reset the record.

Don't worry, as long as you don't clear you browing history, you should never lose your record unless you or someone else performs an action that could reset it.
